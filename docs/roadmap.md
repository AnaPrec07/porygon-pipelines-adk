# Development Roadmap for AI Capabilities in Porygon Pipelines

## Vision Statement
This project aims to develop a comprehensive AI agent that serves as the first layer for data exploration and democratization among business leaders, enabling data-driven decision making across the organization.


## Phase 1: Core Tool Expansion

### 1.1 Creation of Looker Studio Tool
**Objective**: Enable automated dashboard creation and visualization recommendations

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Research Looker Studio API capabilities and limitations
- [ ] Implement `LookerStudioToolset` class following ADK patterns
- [ ] Add authentication for Looker Studio API
- [ ] Create methods for:
  - Dashboard creation/modification
  - Chart generation recommendations
  - Data source connection management
  - Template-based report generation
- [ ] Integration testing with BigQuery data sources

**Deliverables**:
- `root_agent/tools/looker_studio.py`
- Authentication configuration
- Unit tests for Looker Studio operations

### 1.2 Creation of Statistical Patterns Detection Tool
**Objective**: Automatically identify trends, anomalies, and statistical insights

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design statistical analysis framework
- [ ] Implement `StatisticalAnalysisToolset` with capabilities:
  - Trend detection (seasonal, linear, polynomial)
  - Anomaly detection (statistical outliers, time series anomalies)
  - Correlation analysis
  - Distribution analysis
  - Forecasting (basic time series prediction)
  - Integration of lightweight ML algorithm for insight generation

**Deliverables**:
- `root_agent/tools/statistical_analysis.py`
- Statistical models and lightweight ML algorithms
- Insight generation templates

### 1.3 Enhanced Agent Capabilities
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Expand agent instructions for data exploration scenarios
- [ ] Implement context management for multi-step analysis
- [ ] Add memory/session management for conversation continuity
- [ ] Create prompt templates for common data exploration patterns

## Phase 2: AI Monitoring

### 2.1 Monitoring & Observability
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for agent performance and usage

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Usage Analytics**:
  - Query frequency and patterns
  - Tool utilization metrics
  - User interaction patterns
  - Response time tracking
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**:
  - Model response quality scoring
  - Error rate tracking
  - Resource utilization (BigQuery quotas, API limits)
  - Latency monitoring
